Scala code generation from Avro schemas. Generates code similar to [ScalaPB](https://github.com/trueaccord/ScalaPB).

Notably, the generated code for data encapsulation is in the form of case classes. The data representation is completely immutable.

All generated code adheres to the `GeneratedMessageCompanion` type class. This ensures that there exists decode and encode functionality.

working code generation for types:
* enums
* records
* scalar fields (for all types except for byte arrays)
* union fields via shapeless coproducts (for unions not containing NULL)
* optional union fields via shapeless coproducts (for unions containing more than 2 types, one of which is NULL)
* optional fields (for unions containing 2 types, one of which is NULL)
* arrays
* maps
* byte arrays

features:
* generated `org.scalacheck.Gen[_]` instances for generated enums, records

not implemented:
* fixed-length fields
* Generating code from inter-dependent schemas defined in multiple files (currently only handles this case when everything is in the same file).

Subprojects
==================
* runtime: runtime dependencies
* codegen: generates `.scala` files from avro schemas. Currently hardcoded to generate `Out.scala` in sandbox from the avro schemas in the example directory.
* proptest: generates random schemas, generates scala code for the schemas, tests the generated scala code by serializing and deserializing random message instances

To Use
============

There are two ways to use this project. The first is in creating `case class` instances from Avro schemas. The second is in interacting with the generated code. In practice, it's common for a project to do a little bit of both.

For the first use case:

add this to `project/plugins.sbt`
```
addSbtPlugin("com.gonitro" % "avro-codegen-compiler" % "X.Y.Z")
```

where `X.Y.Z` is the most recent version.

Add your avro schemas to `src/main/avro` with the `.avsc` extension. Generated scala classes will be created in `target/scala-2.11/src_managed/main/generated_avro_classes/`.

For the second use case:

When using code generated by this plugin, it is necessary to include the runtime dependency (which includes lots of goodies -- notably the serialization type class `GeneratedMessage`). Therefore, include the following in your `build.sbt`

```
libraryDependencies ++= Seq("com.gonitro" %% "avro-codegen-runtime" % "X.Y.Z")
```
